## Puffysticks React Website
Based on this boilerplate - [MERN-boilerplate](https://github.com/keithweaver/MERN-boilerplate)
The backend was slightly changed to support SocketIO, as it is one of the main technologies that bring this project to life. The communication between client and server is made through WebSockets.
 - [SocketIO](https://socket.io/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for back-end;
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for the frontend;
 - [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for styles (using the SCSS syntax);
 - [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compilation;

Made for a team(me and a buddy) I was a part of. I designed and implemented the whole thing.
It used to be hosted on [https://puffysticks.com/](https://puffysticks.com/)
Development started in Summer 2018 and was officially launched in November followed by few more small updates coming by the end of the year.
